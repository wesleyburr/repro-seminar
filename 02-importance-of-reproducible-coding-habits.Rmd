## Reproducible Research through Coding Habits

In order to ensure research outputs are robust, and to maximize the time,
money, blood, sweat, and tears that went into them, for future researchers
and for society in general, it is critical that we share the underlying
code and data. This allows for replicability of results, and is part
of **computational reproducibility**.

## Have You Ever ...

Karl -- this is very interesting ,
however you used an old version of
the data (n=143 rather than n=226).
I'm really sorry you did all that
work on the incomplete dataset.
- Bruce

## Have You Ever ...

Reviewers come back with some positive feedback for your paper,
but ask that you check something in one of the model runs. When you go to do
so ... nothing matches the output in the paper. Not the figures, not the tables,
not the results. What happened??!?

## Have You Ever ...

## So Why is Is Reproducibility in Coding Important?

- your personal sanity

--

- the great scientific endeavor

--

- having things "just work", like you expect

--

- avoiding embarrassment

---

## Listen to some others ...

File organization and naming is a mighty weapon against chaos
- Jenny Bryan

---

##  Listen to some others ...

You mostly collaborate with yourself, 
and me-from-two-months-ago never responds to email.
- Mark Holder

##  Listen to some others ...

##  Listen to some others ...

The most important tool for Reproducible Research is the mindset, when starting, that the end product will be reproducible.

Basic principles

Step 1: slow down and document.<br/>
Step 2: have sympathy for your future self.<br/>
Step 3: have a system.<br/>

## Tips for Getting Started in Small Ways

- force yourself to organize your course materials in a coherent manner
(assuming you teach); or a *small* research project, if you don't

--

- use Git to store your materials (make them available freely, if you can!) - more soon

--

- create your slides in R Markdown or an equivalent framework

--

- add one piece of the puzzle with each subsequent project

--

- think of all of your outputs as code (including your teaching!)

---

## A Personal Example

I write all of my slides for my big classes in R Markdown. They are knit
as part of a project, and the entire course is a Git repository. This has
a number of advantages:

- all slides can be publicly available

--

- it is very easy to update a course website (build -> commit -> push)

--

- I never lose old slides - they're all on GitHub

--

- it is trivial to cross-link from lecture to lecture, or to reuse material without making multiple copies

--

- the lectures are **code**

---

## What Do I mean "the lectures are code"?

Depending on how computational your statistics world is, this may not
fully sink in. What is **code**?

--

- all text (ASCII or UTF)

--

- editable in any environment, on any computer

--

- rendered in some way to form a final product

--

- trivially versionable

--

Compare this to, e.g., a **pptx** (Microsoft Office - Powerpoint). 
Have you ever tried to open a pptx file in anything **but** Powerpoint? 
Or in anything but a slide editor (e.g., Notepad)?

---

## Tool: usethis

Building good coding habits (and everything is code!) is important. You need
to think of every action or step you take as being something that potentially
will cause you a problem in the future. If you find yourself doing something
manually once ... you'll probably do it manually 100x unless you fix the
design pattern.

**usethis** is a [package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usethis/index.html) developed by folks at RStudio that tries to
help with common tasks that get repeated often.

---

## Tool: usethis

Some common tasks that can be handled with this package:

- setting up Git credentials

--

- create a project from a repo

--

- open/edit R configuration files

--

- interact with a Git repo (branches, commits, etc.)

--

- work with projects or packages

---

## Tool: here

The goal of the **here** package is to enable easy file referencing in project-oriented
workflows. In contrast to using **setwd()**, which is fragile and dependent on the 
way you organize your files, **here** uses the top-level directory of a project 
to easily build paths to files.

```

## Tool: here

The key to **here** is something that can be done manually, but is really important:
machine portability. Fragile things like **setwd()** Do. Not. Work. when transferring
data/code/analyses/projects across different computational environments. 

This is especially bad when going from architecture to architecture - for example,
from a Windows machine to a Mac OS or Linux machine, or vice versa. 

Using **here** for all File Input/Output actions forces compatibility, and 
encourages you to think about your organization structure in a way which is
conducive to computational reproducibility.

## Coming Up Next

In the next session, we will dive into a version of what we have
been calling **version control** called **Git** (first developed by
Linus Torvalds, of the Linux and Linux kernel fame), and introduce the concepts 
necessary to get started.
